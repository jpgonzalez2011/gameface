## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Login/Logout, JSON API for user Account Creation and User Sessions (1 day)

I will begin by implementing User Authentication using BCrypt. I will create a
JSON API for User sign up and to allow users to Login and Logout. I will create
a basic landing page for signing up / logging in, which will be modified later on.
Intention will be to redirect Users to their Profile upon signup/login.

Phase 2 is focused on setting up Flux, the React Router, and the React view

User Profile Pages and Rails backend for Posts CRUD. Photo components will be
filled with placeholders pending implementation of file uploads.
