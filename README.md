### A Fun Implementation Detail

Top Friends are updated in real time by leveraging the relationship between Flux Stores and the Flux Dispatcher.

Every user action eventually creates a dispatch. The FriendStore listens for all such dispatches, even if the intended destination of the payload is another Store, such as the PostStore or CommentStore. When the FriendStore hears a dispatch relating to user interaction it identifies the users between which the interaction has taken place. That data is then passed to the FriendApiUtil which initiates an Ajax request to update the Friendship between those two users.

This aspect of having a universal listener on the FriendStore allows for the real time updates of Top Friends. In later features, this type of arrangement will allow for real time updating of other data points (such as suggested friends and visualizations of user activity on the site).
