## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Login/Logout, JSON API for user Account Creation and User Sessions (1 day)

I will begin by implementing User Authentication using BCrypt. I will create a
JSON API for User sign up and to allow users to Login and Logout. I will create
a basic landing page for signing up / logging in, which will be modified later on.
Intention will be to redirect Users to their Profile upon signup/login.
